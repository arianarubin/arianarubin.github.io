    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>As a photographer, my focus is paying attention to detail and abstraction in our everyday surroundings.  My work consists of abstracted images of architecture and people, and playing with different kinds of light.  For many of my photos, the use of light is significant because I create shapes and shadows, and I experiment with different kinds of light sources.  In addition, for some of my projects, the art process plays an important role in creating the final product.  Even the process of creating an art piece is important and has meaning.  Finally, my work also includes intimate street photography that exposes people and captures intimate moments.  While some of my work is planned out carefully, other pictures are created by going with my gut and making short and hasty decisions.  My photographs represent who I am as an artist and illustrate the formal and conceptual aspects of everyday life.
